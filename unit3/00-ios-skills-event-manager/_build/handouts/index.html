<h1>Self-Assessment: Event Manager</h1>
<p>In this assessment, you will build an event management application. The application should allow you to create events, delete events, and allow you to mark if you are planning to attend the event or not. The event will utilize Core Data. Instructions are provided below, as well as a demo video. Have fun with this application and add your own personal touches. As this is a self-assessment, push yourself to complete this app without assistance, however, if you cannot move past an issue, reach out for support.</p>
<section class="section" id="instructions">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The initial screen shows a list of events. Each row shows the event title and a symbol demonstrating a plan to attend or not attend (you can decide on the symbols, but they must be different for attending vs not attending).</p></li>
<li><p>There will be a button (you can decide what it looks like) that will navigate the user to an empty detail view, allowing the user to add an event to the list of events.</p></li>
<li><p>Tapping on the attending button will toggle the events attending state.</p></li>
<li><p>Tapping on a cell will navigate the user to a detail view, where they can see the events details, modify the events details, and re-save the event.</p></li>
<li><p>Swiping on a cell will delete an event.</p></li>
<li><p>Quitting the app and re-launching it will accurately show your events and attending state (core data persistence).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to use any extra time to challenge yourself with the black diamonds and make your app look good.</p>
<section class="section" id="going-further">
<h3>Going Further</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add local notifications to display when the app is closed or in background mode. The notification should let a user know which event is starting.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement sectioning to events attending and events not attending in separate sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the ability for your app to receive banner &amp; sound notifications while the app is in the foreground.</p></li>
</ul>
