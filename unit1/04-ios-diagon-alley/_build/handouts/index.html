<h1>Diagon Alley Shopping Trip</h1>
<p>In this project, you will write about your first trip to Diagon alley for your school supplies. You will do this by creating variables or constants, whichever is more appropriate, of your personal data. You’ll use what you’ve learned about the various operators to keep track of how much gold, or galleons, you have… You’ll also use control flow to help you decide which house you hope to be in and what pet to take with you on day one! Let’s tour Diagon Alley!</p>
<section class="section" id="part-one-basic-personal-details">
<h2>Part One - Basic Personal Details</h2>
<p>For the following, consider what type should be used and whether a variable or a constant will be best.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for your first name</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for your last name</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for your age</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for your birthday</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for your preferred wand length</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for your preferred house</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant for the character trait that best represents you: Brave, Loyal, Ambitious, or Intelligent</p></li>
<li><p>create a variable or a constant that showcases if you are tired of Harry Potter references</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section" id="part-two-mathematical-operators">
<h2>Part Two - Mathematical Operators</h2>
<p>Create a variable or a constant for your vaults gold volume. Please use a double - and set the value to 150.0. Please use this same variable or constant throughout the next few questions. The amount should update properly.</p>
<p>Write a line of code to update your vaults gold for each of the following experiences.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You walk into Ollivanders to buy your first wand. The cost is 24.3</p></li>
<li><p>Next, you walk into Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. You purchase a very fine set of Robes that cost you a flat 45 Galleons.</p></li>
<li><p>As you walk past Gringotts Wizarding Bank you are stopped by a very excited Goblin who explains that they’ve been waiting for you. A long lost relative left you some gold to be used on your first day. Add 300 Galleons</p></li>
<li><p>As you move along Diagon Alley you hear some noise down Knockturn Alley. A group of Slytherins are playing Wizard dice. You play a few rounds and double the gold in your purse.</p></li>
<li><p>With your new purse bursting at the seams you walk into Borgin and Burkes. You inquire about a pack of bloodstained cards and he says he will give it to you for one tenth of all the gold in your pocket</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section" id="part-three-conditional-love">
<h2>Part Three - Conditional Love</h2>
<p>For the third part of this project, we are going to practice our knowledge of conditional statements. Please rewrite the following sentences into code:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When choosing an owl at the Eeylops Owl Emporium, I want to choose an owl that has a black beak and white feathers. Once I find an owl like that, I will exclaim “This one’s mine!”. If the owl does not match what I want, I will say “Pass”.</p></li>
<li><p>I heard that my favorite Quidditch team, The Holyhead Harpies, suggests a certain type of Broom. So, I will only buy a broom if it is sponsored by them.</p></li>
<li><p>While taking a break and enjoying a sweet treat at Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour, you begin to daydream about the four houses of Hogwarts. Slytherin for the cunning and ambitious, Gryffindor for the brave, Hufflepuff for the Loyal, and Ravenclaw for those with great wit. What could be the specific thought process and logic which the sorting hat employs in order to appropriately place students?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section" id="part-four-functions">
<h2>Part Four - Functions</h2>
<p>In part four, we are going down to Honeydukes where we can buy all sorts of delicious treats!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Honeydukes sells their Fizzing Whizzbees for 2 galleons each. Write a function that takes in an Int to represent how many Fizzing Whizzbees you would like to buy. Inside the body of the function, subtract the appropriate amount of money from your vault’s gold (part 2), based on the amount of Fizzing Whizzbees you are purchasing.</p></li>
<li><p>You decide you want to buy some Chocolate Frogs for your whole family, but at 3 galleons each, you aren’t entirely sure you have enough money. Write a function that takes in the size of your family as a parameter. In the body of the function, determine how much it would cost to buy all the Chocolate Frogs that you would need, and then use a conditional to determine if you have enough money in your vault or not. If you do, print out “We’ll take the lot.” and subtract the money from your vault. If you do not have the money, print “No thanks, I’m all set.”</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section" id="part-five-loops-loops-loops-repeat">
<h2>Part Five - Loops, Loops, Loops, repeat</h2>
<p>Finally, you cannot forget to buy your books before you go to Hogwarts. Use loops (you can determine which is the best) to complete the following problems.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create a variable called bookPrices and set it equal to [12, 15, 22, 10, 8, 17]. Combining a loop and a conditional statement, iterate through each price in bookPrices and, if the book is greater than 15 galleons, print “This book is expensive!” Otherwise, print “This book isn’t too bad.”</p></li>
<li><p>On your way out of Diagon Alley you realize you still have money in your vault, and it doesn’t do you any good there. So you decide to head back to Honeydukes to load up on as many Pixie Puffs as you can get. The Pixie Puffs are 3 galleons each. Write a loop that continues to buy Pixie Puffs as long as you have enough money for them. Create a variable called totalPixiePuff to keep track of how many you were able to buy.</p></li>
</ul>
