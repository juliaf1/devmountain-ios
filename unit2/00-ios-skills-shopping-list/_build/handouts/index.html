<h1>Self-Assessment Shopping List</h1>
<p>Please watch the screen recording provided in the download folder before starting this self-assessment. It demonstrates the application you are to create.</p>
<p>In this self-assessment, you will build a shopping list application. The shopping list should allow you to create shopping items, as well as check them off if they have been purchased.</p>
<section class="section" id="instructions">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The initial screen should show a list of shopping items. Each row shows the item title and a checkbox (checked if purchased, unchecked if not).</p></li>
<li><p>There should be an add button that will allow the user to add shopping list item to the list of shopping items. This can be done by using a text field on the table view controller. It can also be done with an alert controller.</p></li>
<li><p>Tapping on a checkbox will toggle the items purchased state.</p></li>
<li><p>Quitting the app and re-launching it will show your shopping items and their purchased state (persistence).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Going Further</strong>
- Use an alert controller to prompt the user for a shopping item.
- Implement sectioning to show purchased and non-purchased items in separate sections.
- Add a detail view which allows the quantity of an item to be changed, as well as an itemâ€™s purchased state.</p>
